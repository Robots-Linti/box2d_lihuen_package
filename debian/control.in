Description: Python Bindings for the 2D Physics Engine Box2D
 2D rigid body simulation library for games. Programmers can use it in their 
 games to make objects move in believable ways and make the world seem more 
 interactive. From the game's point of view a physics engine is just a system 
 for procedural animation. Rather than paying (or begging) an animator to move 
 your actors around, you can let Sir Isaac Newton do the directing.
 . 
 This package contains the Python bindings for Box2D.
